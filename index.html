<h1>Errbit</h1>

<h2>The open source, self-hosted error catcher</h2>

Errbit is a tool for collecting and managing errors from other applications. It
is Airbrake API compliant, so if you are already using Airbrake, you can just
point the airbrake gem to your Errbit server.

Documentation is available for all released versions of Errbit and master. It
is built directly from whatever documentation was available in the ./docs
folder at the time of release.
